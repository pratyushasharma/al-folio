I am a PhD student in EECS at MIT advised by [Prof. Antonio Torralba](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/) and [Prof. Jacob Andreas](http://web.mit.edu/jda/www/). 

My research goal is to understand what can be learnt from rich multimodal interactions (vision, touch and sounds) with objects (and people) in the world around us. I am also interested in  developing  systems that enable robots to efficiently abstract knowledge across tasks, reason, understand goals and reliably interact in the real world. 

Prior to this I was at Carnegie Mellon University for a year long research internship advised by [Prof. Abhinav Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhinavg/). Even before that I was an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
